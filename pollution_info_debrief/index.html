	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Real-world congestion zones are imperfect because they charge heterogeneous road users
uniform prices, and invite externality spillovers in space and time. I show that given these imperfections, calculating optimal prices requires (i) individual-level externalities, (ii) individual elasticities, and (iii) cross-price elasticities between priced and unpriced trips. Using
tolling microdata from California, I estimate a model of driving demand that yields these parameters. I then estimate optimal prices for proposed zones in three U.S. cities. I find that leakage pushes second-best prices below trip-level externalities, and that optimal peak pricing recovers just 30-40% of the welfare gains of a first-best policy.</p>
