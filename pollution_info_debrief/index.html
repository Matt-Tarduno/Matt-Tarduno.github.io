	<h1><b>Survey Debrief</b></h1>

	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> In this study, we asked respondents three questions about air pollution: (1) How high is the air pollution level in your zipcode, (2) How does the air pollution level in your zip code compare to other zip codes in your state? and (3) If air pollution were to increase by 50% in the United States, how would that impact average life expectancies?

<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> The goal of this research is to understand what people think about air pollution, and how those beliefs impact their demand for clean air.
		<br>
		<br>
Some respondents were randomized to the control arm and received no information about any of these questions. All the other respondents received a piece of information corresponding to one of the three questions above. Within each question, the information that an individual received was randomly drawn from one of two academic sources. 
		<br>
		<br>
Below are each of the two raw sources of information for each question about air pollution. To view information about questions (1) and (2), click the red link below and search for your zip code. The information for question (3) is not zip code specific.
We stress that one source is not more ''correct'' than the other. All of the information on this page is from peer-reviewed research, and differences in conclusions about pollution exposure, zip code pollution ranks, or health outcomes result from different methodologies and data sources used by the original researchers.
