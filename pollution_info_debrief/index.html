	<h1>Pollution Information Survey Debrief</h1>

	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> In this study, we asked respondents three questions about air pollution: (1) How high is the air pollution level in your zipcode, (2) How does the air pollution level in your zip code compare to other zip codes in your state? and (3) If air pollution were to increase by 50% in the United States, how would that impact average life expectancies?
		<br>
Some respondents were randomized to the control arm and received no information about any of these questions. All the other respondents received information about one question. The information that an individual received was randomly drawn from one of two sources. <br>
Below are links to each of the two raw sources of information.  .</p>
