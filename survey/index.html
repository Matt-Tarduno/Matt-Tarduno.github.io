	<p><b>Purpose</b></p>

<p>The purpose of this survey is to understand how tax incidence influences voter support for ballot initiatives. To investigate this question this survey asks participants to answer whether or not they support actual and hypothetical ballot initiatives. We also record how these answers change when participants are provided with information about the private costs of ballot initiatives. ﻿﻿Your participation in this survey is voluntary; you can withdraw at any time.﻿﻿</p> 

<p>The information you provide through this survey will be used solely for academic research, and will only be shared with this project's principal investigators: ﻿Berkeley Associate Professor James Sallee and UC Berkeley Ph.D. Candidate Matthew Tarduno. If you have questions or comments about the survey, please contact us at tarduno@berkeley.edu.﻿</p> 


<b><p>Confidentiality</p></b>

<p>Your confidentiality is important to us. There is a chance your data could be seen by someone who shouldn’t have access to it. We’re minimizing this risk in the following ways: First, Qualtrics uses TLS encryption in storing and downloading data, which makes it more difficult for third parties to gain access to survey responses. ﻿﻿Second, we will de-identify and encrypt all data stored on principal investigator laptops. Your survey responses will be kept indefinitely for research replication purposes, but any archived data will be de-identified.  ﻿﻿</p> 

<p>It is important that we safeguard your Amazon ID because Amazon or third parties could hypothetically link your worker ID (and associated personal information) with your survey responses. Make sure you have read Amazon’s mTurk participant and privacy agreements to understand how your personal information may be used or disclosed. ﻿</p> 


<b><p>Institutional Review </p></b>

<p>This study was approved by the UC Berkeley Institutional Review Board (CPHS ID ﻿2020-05-13321). If you have comments or concerns about this survey and would like to speak with someone other than the principal investigators, please contact ﻿CPHS/OPHS at ﻿510-642-7461 or ophs@berkeley.edu.  </p>
