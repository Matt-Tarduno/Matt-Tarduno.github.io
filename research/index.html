	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Abstract: I study the impact of transportation network companies (TNC) on traffic delays using a natural experiment created by the abrupt departure of Uber and Lyft from Austin, TX. Applying difference in
differences and regression discontinuity specifications to high-frequency traffic data, I estimate that Uber
and Lyft together decreased daytime traffic speeds in Austin by roughly 2.3%. Using Austin-specific
measures of the value of travel time, I translate these slowdowns to estimates of citywide congestion
costs that range from $33 to $52 million dollars annually. Back of the envelope calculations imply that
these costs are similar in magnitude to the consumer surplus provided by TNCs in Austin. Together
these results suggest that while TNCs may impose modest travel time externalities, restricting or taxing
TNC activity is unlikely to generate large net welfare gains through reduced congestion.</p>
