	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Abstract: I study the impact of transportation network companies (TNC) on traffic delays using a natural experiment created by the abrupt departure of Uber and Lyft from Austin, TX. Applying difference in
differences and regression discontinuity specifications to high-frequency traffic data, I estimate that Uber
and Lyft together decreased daytime traffic speeds in Austin by roughly 2.3%. Using Austin-specific
measures of the value of travel time, I translate these slowdowns to estimates of citywide congestion
costs that range from $33 to $52 million dollars annually. Back of the envelope calculations imply that
these costs are similar in magnitude to the consumer surplus provided by TNCs in Austin. Together
these results suggest that while TNCs may impose modest travel time externalities, restricting or taxing
TNC activity is unlikely to generate large net welfare gains through reduced congestion.</p>

	<p style="font-size:18px; font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black" > Tarduno, Matthew, 2020. <em>What drives support for inefficient corrective policies?

	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Abstract: 
	I use an information provision experiment conducted around a vote on Nevada’s renewable portfolio standard
	(RPS) to study voter preferences for externality-correcting policies. I leverage exogenous variation in respondent
	beliefs induced by the experiment to model policy support as a function of voter perceptions of policy attributes
	(cost, effectiveness, and regressivity). I find that voting behavior is relatively unresponsive to perceived cost and
	perceived regressivity, but relatively responsive to perceived policy effectiveness. Using this model, I decompose
	differences in support for a performance-based policy (Nevada’s RPS) and a hypothetical price-based policy (a
	carbon tax). Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions imply that differences in perceptions of policy attributes explain
	just 23% of the gap in support between RPS policies and carbon taxes, suggesting a significant role for “tax
	aversion.” To the extent that misperceptions of policy attributes do explain differences in support for these
	two policies, the explained gap results from overly optimistic beliefs about RPS attributes. To conclude, I
	predict voting behavior several under counterfactual scenarios. I find that in this setting, targeting revenue
	toward “swing” voters is unlikely to significantly improve support for carbon taxes. Instead, the results of this
	experiment highlight the importance of communicating to voters the efficacy of price-based policies. </p>
