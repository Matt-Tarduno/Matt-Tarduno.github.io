    <p id="abstract1" class="abstract">
        This paper explores whether misperceptions about air pollution contribute to environmental inequality in the United States. 
        We use a two-part survey experiment to elicit respondents’ beliefs about local air quality and pollution’s effects on life expectancy. 
        We document how misperception differs across demographic groups and then how this misperception affects willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. 
        Since misperception or beliefs may be correlated with other unobservable determinants of WTP, we randomly show selected participants customized information about their actual air pollution. 
        This allows us to trace out how experimentally induced changes in beliefs affect WTP for air quality. Our results suggest significant misperceptions about air pollution in the US. 
        Respondents, on average, overestimate both their air pollution exposure and its impact on life expectancy. 
        Beliefs about relative air pollution are not systematically biased but are noisy. 
        Despite some differences in misperceptions between Black and White respondents, counterfactual exercises do not suggest that rectifying these misperceptions would meaningfully close the observed gap in WTP and/or pollution exposure.

        Real-world congestion zones are imperfect because they charge heterogeneous road users uniform prices, and invite externality spillovers in space and time. I show that given these imperfections, calculating optimal prices requires (i) individual-level externalities, (ii) individual
elasticities, and (iii) cross-price elasticities between priced and unpriced trips. Using bridge toll
microdata and a natural experiment where peak-hour pricing was imposed on one of the San Francisco Bay Area’s 4 trans-bay bridges, I estimate a discrete choice model of driving demand
that yields these parameters. I then use this model to estimate optimal prices for proposed
congestion zones in three U.S. cities. I find that leakage pushes second-best prices below triple-level externalities, and that optimal peak pricing recovers just 10-41% of the welfare gains of a
first-best policy.

We provide a framework for setting congestion charges that reflect emission and congestion externalities and policy responses, such as vehicle ownership, driving, and residential sorting. Using Swedish administrative microdata, we identify these responses by exploiting a temporary exemption for alternative fuel vehicles and variation in individuals’ exposure to congestion charges. We find that commuters respond by adopting exempted alternative fuel vehicles, shifting trips away from fossil fuel toward alternative fuel vehicles, and changing where they live and work. We combine the estimated responses with the framework to recover an optimal congestion charge of €9.46 per crossing in Stockholm.    </p>

I use an information provision experiment conducted around a vote on Nevada’s renewable portfolio standard
(RPS) to study voter preferences for externality-correcting policies. I leverage exogenous variation in respondent
beliefs induced by the experiment to model policy support as a function of voter perceptions of policy attributes
(cost, effectiveness, and regressivity). I find that voting behavior is relatively unresponsive to perceived cost and
perceived regressivity, but relatively responsive to perceived policy effectiveness. Using this model, I decompose
differences in support for a performance-based policy (Nevada’s RPS) and a hypothetical price-based policy (a
carbon tax). Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions imply that differences in perceptions of policy attributes explain
just 23% of the gap in support between RPS policies and carbon taxes, suggesting a significant role for “tax
aversion.” To the extent that misperceptions of policy attributes do explain differences in support for these two
policies, the explained gap results from overly optimistic beliefs about RPS attributes. To conclude, I predict
voting behavior under several counterfactual scenarios. I find that in this setting, targeting revenue toward
“swing” voters is unlikely to significantly improve support for carbon taxes. Instead, the results of this pilot
experiment highlight the importance of communicating to voters the efficacy of price-based policies.    </p>

This paper answers three questions about ridesharing taxes: (i) How elastic is ridesharing with respect to taxation? 
        (ii) How effective are ridesharing taxes at addressing traffic-related externalities? And (iii), 
        who bears the burden of ridesharing taxes? Using data from Chicago, I show that ridesharing demand is inelastic in gross terms, 
        and relative to supply. Accordingly, 85% of the city’s tax falls on passengers. Consistent with inelastic demand, 
        I find little evidence of changes in congestion or air pollution in US cities that recently imposed ridesharing taxes. 
        Finally, ridesharing taxes are roughly as progressive as the federal income tax schedule.    </p>
