	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Real-world congestion zones are imperfect because they charge heterogeneous road users
uniform prices, and invite externality spillovers in space and time. I show that given these imperfections, calculating optimal prices requires (i) individual-level externalities, (ii) individual elasticities, and (iii) cross-price elasticities between priced and unpriced trips. Using
tolling microdata from California, I estimate a model of driving demand that yields these parameters. I then estimate optimal prices for proposed zones in three U.S. cities. I find that leakage pushes second-best prices below trip-level externalities, and that optimal peak pricing recovers just 30-40% of the welfare gains of a first-best policy.</p>

	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Abstract: I study the impact of transportation network companies (TNC) on traffic delays using a natural experiment created by the abrupt departure of Uber and Lyft from Austin, TX. Applying difference in
differences and regression discontinuity specifications to high-frequency traffic data, I estimate that Uber
and Lyft together decreased daytime traffic speeds in Austin by roughly 2.3%. Using Austin-specific
measures of the value of travel time, I translate these slowdowns to estimates of citywide congestion
costs that range from $33 to $52 million dollars annually. Back of the envelope calculations imply that
these costs are similar in magnitude to the consumer surplus provided by TNCs in Austin. Together
these results suggest that while TNCs may impose modest travel time externalities, restricting or taxing
TNC activity is unlikely to generate large net welfare gains through reduced congestion.</p>

	<p style="font-size:18px; font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black" > Tarduno, Matthew, 2020. <em>What drives support for inefficient environmental policies?</em> <br><span style="color: #808080">Berkeley Law, Economics, and Politics Center Working Paper.</span>
	<p style="margin-left:3em">[<a href="https://matt-tarduno.github.io/nevada/" target="_blank">pilot results</a>]
	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Negative externalities are often regulated with performance standards (e.g., fuel economy standards) where economic theory suggests that price-based mechanisms (e.g., fuel taxes) offer a more efficient alternative. The relative popularity of performance-based policies  is puzzling: 
	Given the cost-effectiveness of Pigouvian taxation and the ability of governments to pair these policies with redistribution, it should be possible to construct a price-based regulation that dominates a performance-based alternative on at least one of the three dimensions of efficacy, fairness, or cost, holding fixed the others. 
		In this paper, I use an information provision experiment to understand what drives differences in voter support for these two policy types. Specifically, this experiment allows me to answer two questions: How do voters' perceptions of policy cost, effectiveness, and regressivity influence policy support? And do misperceptions of policy attributes explain the relative popularity of nontax corrective policies? Preliminary results from a pilot experiment conducted around a 2020 energy ballot initiative suggest that voters overestimate the effectiveness of performance-based policies at reducing carbon emissions. Oaxaca-blinder decompositions, however, suggest that differences in beliefs about policy attributes explain only a quarter of the difference in support for performance vs. price-based policies. As a result, neither rectifying misperceptions about policy attributes, nor redesigning price-based policies to compensate swing voters appear likely to significantly bolster support for price-based corrective policies. 	</p>
